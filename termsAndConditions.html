      <h2>TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Vishmate ("we", "our", or "us"), a poster maker app designed
        to provide ready-to-use templates for restaurants, theaters, political
        events, and jewelry promotions. By accessing or using our website and
        mobile application (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to comply
        with and be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not
        agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use the Service.
      </p>
      <h4>Using Vishmate :</h4>
      <p>
        Vishmate is a visual design platform that empowers users to create a
        variety of posters tailored to specific categories, including
        restaurants, theaters, political events, and jewelry promotions (each a
        "Design"). When you use the Service, you’ll have access to a range of
        content provided by Vishmate and other content providers to use in your
        designs (“Licensed Content”). You also have the option to upload your
        own content (“User Content”), such as images, text, and files, which you
        have full control and responsibility over. You can use Licensed Content,
        your User Content, and the tools available in Vishmate to create your
        Designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service is made available on Vishmate.com, Vishmate mobile apps,
        Vishmate desktop applications, and in other forms provided or made
        available by Vishmate. Your use of the Service is subject to these Terms
        and Vishmate’s Acceptable Use Policy. By using the Service, you
        acknowledge and agree to Vishmate’s Privacy Policy.
      </p>

        supplemental to these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with
        Vishmate and are legally permitted to do so. By using the Service, you
        represent and warrant that you have the full right, power, and authority
        to agree to and be bound by these Terms and to fully perform all of your
        obligations hereunder.

        Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you are granted a
        non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to

        conducted on your account. You may not allow any other party to access
        or use the Service with your unique username, password, or other
        security code.

      <h4>Acceptable Use Policy:</h4>
